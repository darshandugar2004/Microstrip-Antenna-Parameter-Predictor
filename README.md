# Microstrip-Antenna-Parameter-Predictor
Summer Research
1. Microstrip Line is Used for Signal transmission in wide range if devices. Here we a Developed a FNN that is trained on data obtained from analysing antenna for multiple specifications.
2. An Application is developed in python using Tkinter which takes input from user and predict the length of Inset Feed and Notch Gap.
